# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Solving-the-Inverse-Kinematics-Problem

In this project, it is intended to develop a deep neural network model for solving
the inverse kinematics problem for the planar robotic manipulator with two
revolute joints presented in Fig. 1. To train the neural network, a large dataset
of joint angles and their corresponding end effector position and orientation will
be needed. We will utilize the forward kinematic equations in (1) of the tackled
robotic manipulator to generate this data set. Afterwards, we will train a deep
network on the generated data and validate its performance on an unseen test
data.
